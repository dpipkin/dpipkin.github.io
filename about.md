I am a current student at Western Governors University. I will be graduating in April 2017 with a B.S. in Data Management/Data Analytics. My interests include learning analytics and artificial intelligence. I enjoy spending time outdoors or playing Nintendo consoles in my free time.

I have experience with Python, R, and SAS. I worked as a full-time developer in 2015 using Ruby on Rails and Angular 1.x.
